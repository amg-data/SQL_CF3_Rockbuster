Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that fomerly had stores around the world. Facing strong competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.
